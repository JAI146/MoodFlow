🧩 Problem

Students often struggle with studying not because they lack motivation, but because they don’t know what to work on, when to work on it, or how to study effectively.

Most existing tools fall into two categories:

Scheduling apps that ignore a student’s mood, energy, and mental state.

Learning platforms that provide content but don’t consider a student’s real schedule, deadlines, or available time.

As a result, students feel overwhelmed, procrastinate, or waste small pockets of free time because they don’t know what task fits their current situation.

💡 Solution

We built a smart, mood-aware scheduling and learning web app that helps students decide what to study right now.

The app works by combining:

the user’s mood and energy level (low, moderate, high),

their schedule, including assignments and upcoming exams,

and their available time (e.g. 15, 30, or 60 minutes).

Based on these inputs, the system recommends the most suitable task — such as:

assignment work,

exam preparation,

or short, focused coding practice sessions inspired by Monkeytype, but using real code instead of plain text.

For coding practice, users type and practice real examples (e.g. Python basics), receive instant feedback, and the app keeps track of what they have already learned so future sessions continue from where they left off.

Our goal is to reduce decision fatigue and help students make consistent progress by turning every study session — even short ones — into meaningful learning.
